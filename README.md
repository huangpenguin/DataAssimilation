# Data Assimilation
Documentary(Knowledgement,sourse codes) for intense course mainly about data assimilation('データ同化'), an important concept for prediction work especially in the filed of Meteorology. 

As I'm from the department of geometics, somehow the method uesd here is highly related to what we use in GIS/surveying field to deal with 'Error propogation'.

Key words: Kalman Filter, EnKF(ensemble),Adjoint-EnKF
